# Advancing-Jetbot-Capabilities-for-Object-Transportation
This project showcases the ability in robotics, particularly in autonomous navigation and object transportation using ROS, Aruco markers, and RRT algorithms
Led a project aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Jetbot platform for autonomous object transportation within factory environments. Leveraged the Robot Operating System (ROS), Aruco markers, and Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithms to develop a comprehensive system enabling Jetbot to navigate through complex environments, identify obstacles using Aruco markers, and successfully transport payloads to their destinations.
